## 🚀 About the Project

🎉 I built a fun **browser-based Sudoku Game** in under **30 minutes** using the power of **Amazon Q Developer CLI** – a generative AI tool that turns natural language prompts into real code!

> Yes, I joined the movement too → `#BuildWithAmazonQ` 🔥

🧠 Amazon Q CLI allowed me to describe features in plain English, and it generated the full HTML/CSS/JS code for a playable Sudoku board.

## 🧩 What is Sudoku?

Sudoku is a **classic logic-based number puzzle** played on a 9x9 grid, divided into **nine 3x3 subgrids**.

### 🧠 The Goal:
Fill the grid so that:
- ✅ Each **row** contains digits `1–9` without repetition
- ✅ Each **column** contains digits `1–9` without repetition
- ✅ Each **3x3 block** contains digits `1–9` without repetition
